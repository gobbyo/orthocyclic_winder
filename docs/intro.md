# Why Create Custom Magnetic Coils

Commercial coils rarely match the exact geometry or electrical characteristics a project demands. Building your own lets you tailor the coil’s size, shape, number of turns, and wire pattern so it fits your hardware and meets your target inductance, resistance, and thermal performance. For prototyping, research, or unusual applications—like wireless‑power coils, precision sensors, or custom electromagnets—DIY winding is often the only practical option and far cheaper than ordering custom parts.

## Ortho Cyclic Winder

An **ortho cyclic winder** produces the highest‑density, highest‑efficiency coils by packing each turn into a hexagonal, honeycomb‑like pattern. Achieving this requires tightly synchronized traverse motion, constant wire tension, and perfect layer alignment—far more precision than simple helical or random winding.


## Pros and Cons for Magnetic Coil Efficiency

Pros:

- Maximum magnetic efficiency per unit volume
- Lower resistance due to more copper and shorter wire length
- Highly repeatable geometry

Cons:

- Extremely sensitive to tension, alignment, and wire uniformity (no kinks, bends, or lumpy enamel coating)
- If the first layer is off, every layer after is compromised
- Requires precise traverse-to-spool control and synchronization
- Not ideal for very thick wire

## Why Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Ortho Cyclic Winding Is Hard (but not impossible)

Producing true orthocyclic layers demands accurate phase‑locked traverse motion, consistent tension, and a flawless first layer. Mechanical precision—zero backlash, smooth stepper motion, and reliable encoder feedback—is essential to keep each turn aligned and each layer nested correctly.

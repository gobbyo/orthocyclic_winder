# Definitions, Assumptions, and Calculations

The purpose of this document is to preserve the assumptions and calculations made for this ortho-cyclic winder.

## Assumptions

It is designed for the following enamel coated magnetic wire:

**AWG** = American Gauge Wire

**Bare Cu** = bare copper wire

**Nominal OD** = the outer diameter of the wire, including the enamel. Note the outer diameter may vary slightly and is an approximated measurement.

| AWG | Bare Cu (mm) | Nominal OD (mm) |

## Definitions

### Spool

- Flange diameter
- Barrel diameter
- Arbor hole diameter
- Driver hole diameter
- Overall width
- Traverse length

### Hourglass-shaped bobbin

Provides a restoring lateral component that nudges the wire back toward the center when it drifts. The bobbin actively helps to center and track the wire with less dependence on perfect traverse synchronization.

### Supply spool

The spool that supplies the wire, or the spool of wire that is unwound from.

### Take-up spool

The spool that is being wound, or the spool the wire is wound into.
